Roads are an important form of infrastructure investment that affect firms’ production functions and people’s commuting costs. Many studies examine the importance of roads and how they affect residents' daily lives (\Citeauthor{currier2023} \citeyear{currier2023}; \Citeauthor{adukia2020} \citeyear{adukia2020}, \Citeauthor{banerjee2020} \citeyear{banerjee2020}; \Citeauthor{banerjee2020} \citeyear{banerjee2020}, \Citeauthor{banerjee2020} \citeyear{banerjee2020}). Some papers emphasize that building new roads increases employment and entry of new firms \citep{gibbons2019new}, thereby increasing economic activity. Other papers point out the potential for worse outcomes in the form of increased inequality between the rich and the poor \citep{hettige2006} and an exodus of workers seeking access to larger labor markets \citep{asher2020}.  
 
In this paper, we highlight the importance of maintaining road spending for cities in Ohio. We collect data on more than 3,000 road-tax levy renewal elections conducted within different county subdivisions (referred to as “cities”)  in Ohio. Using regression discontinuity design, we examine how cuts in maintenance spending influence key economic outcomes, focusing on cities where voting results were narrowly decided. Our results reveal that cutting maintenance spending by 34\% decreases house prices by \$20,729, with the effect starting four years after the vote and persisting through nine years after the vote. The \$20,729 discount represents about 12 percent of house value over the decade.  The delayed effect is consistent with the time it might take for roads to deteriorate noticeably.  We further find that these price effects are more pronounced in urban areas, where house prices fall by approximately \$25,825 on average, compared to no significant changes in rural areas. We also observe that higher-priced homes experience larger reductions in value relative to lower-priced homes, indicating a heterogeneous impact across different quantiles of home prices. On the other hand, we find little evidence for any overall change in wages or employment as a result of the decreased road maintenance spending for our full sample.  We do find, however, an effect on employment and wages in high-poverty cities.  Cities above the 75th percentile of poverty that cut road maintenance taxes have 17.8\% lower wages than otherwise similar cities that barely renew road tax levies.  High-poverty cities that cut road tax levies also lose about 11\% more jobs than those that successfully renew maintenance spending.  We speculate that the amenity value of attractive roads, changes in business productivity, and compensating wage differentials are probably responsible for the results, rather than changes in traffic noise or crime rates.

Perhaps the study most related to ours is \cite{asher2020}, which studies the impact of new roads on villages in India. Like our study, its identification strategy is regression discontinuity, although ours is sharp rather than the fuzzy form.  It argues the main obstacle to identification in prior studies is that the placement of new roads is usually correlated with economic (or political) characteristics rather than exogenous.  Its findings suggest this is a serious problem with the literature because, unlike prior studies, it finds no strong link between economic growth and new road placement, suggesting that the estimates of previous studies that find a link are driven by road placement in villages that are already growing. \cite{asher2020} touts its use of village-level rather than regional-level data.  We, too, look at economic outcomes at the level of village, city, and township, the most local levels of government.  A surprising finding of \cite{asher2020} is that investment in transportation infrastructure does not affect village incomes, assets, or agricultural output.  Its measure of assets is a village-level average of a series of binary indicators of ownership of a variety of assets, along with separate regressions for the presence of a ‘solid house’, refrigerator, and phone; whereas we study the effect of transportation spending on wages, employment, and housing sale prices.  Of course, our use of a developed geography contrasts with rural villages in India.  Our efforts to achieve identification focus on the maintenance of existing roads, which avoids the endogeneity of the placement of new roads.

We highlight a substantial literature studying the effect of transportation infrastructure on house prices. \cite{hoogendoorn2019house} studies the effect of opening of a tunnel on house prices in the Netherlands, noting that prior research studying transportation infrastructure in developed geographies suffers from reverse causality.  It argues that the opening of the Westerscheldtunnel is a fairly exogenous event, with natural borders that prevent contamination of results by the surrounding environment.  It finds half the capitalized value of the tunnel occurs more than a year before the tunnel opens.  Our data, too, is for a developed nation. \cite{hoogendoorn2019house} argues that the exogeneity of the opening of the tunnel, along with hedonic controls, time trends and postcode fixed effects, identifies its estimates.  One novelty of our study is how ordinary the events are that we study.  While the opening of a new tunnel is important, it is rare.  Votes to renew infrastructure spending are common events in many local governments in the United States, and the quantity of road maintenance spending is regularly chosen by governments around the world, if not by voting then directly by bureaucrats.  It is therefore also important to study the effects of road maintenance spending on house prices. \cite{li2016wheels} studies the overall effect on apartment prices of new subway lines in Beijing, but the estimates may be a net effect of competing factors. \cite{gibbons2005valuing}, studying the construction of new rail stations for the London underground and light rail services, notes that the effect on house prices captures the net effect of better access, increased crime, and increased noise pollution. \cite{levkovich2016effects} looks at the effect of highway development on house prices in the Netherlands.  It separates out accessibility effects from noise pollution and increased traffic effects by looking at different neighborhoods near the highway development.  Its repeat sales difference in differences model finds increased house prices from anticipation effects \citep{kohlhase1991impact}. \cite{beenstock2016hedonic} also finds anticipation effects for house prices (but not new construction) for the development of a highway across Israel. 

We also cite literature assessing the effect of transportation infrastructure on employment and wages. Gibbons et al 2019 analyze how new road infrastructure in Britain affects employment and labor productivity. It finds that while new roads increase area-level employment and the number of firms, they may lead to job reductions in existing firms, coupled with increased wages and output per worker \citep{duranton2012}. This study focuses on the long-term effects of transportation infrastructure on employment, highlighting how improved transit can shift the spatial concentration of industries and workers. Their findings show a significant relationship between transportation improvements and shifts in employment, especially in urban areas. Our results are also consistent with \cite{gibbons2019new} in that changes in road investment do not seem to be related to employment at the establishment level.  Neither \cite{dalenberg1995effects} nor \cite{gibbons2019new} look at the effect of transportation infrastructure in high-poverty areas specifically.  While we find no link between transportation infrastructure investment and wages or employment in our overall sample, we do find a link in high-poverty cities.

Our paper contributes to the literature on three main fronts. First, instead of studying the economic implications of constructing new roads, we look at the maintenance of existing roadways, a much more commonplace occurrence and therefore possibly more relevant to public policy. In fact, the exogenous shock we study, cutting maintenance spending, is essentially the opposite of the increased infrastructure more commonly studied.  
Second, while much of the literature focuses on developing nations, where infrastructure expansion is a primary concern and reverse causality is easier to address, we shift the focus to a developed economy, where the challenges are different and centered around the maintenance of aging infrastructure. This provides insights that are more relevant for policymakers in advanced economies, where road infrastructure is well established but requires continuous upkeep to avoid economic decline.
Third, we focus on long-term effects of reduced road maintenance on house prices, with statistically significant declines occurring only after four years and persisting through nine years. This delayed effect highlights how the consequences of infrastructure spending cuts are not immediate but gradually accumulate as roads deteriorate. Our research also identifies heterogeneous impacts, showing that urban areas and higher-priced homes suffer more pronounced price declines. By focusing on distributional effects, the study adds nuance to the understanding of how infrastructure maintenance affects local housing markets.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section I provides background information on the data and provides information about the variables used in the study. Section II outlines the empirical strategy. Section III presents the results of the study and shares the relevant robustness checks. Section IV discusses mechanisms. Section V concludes.

\section{Background \& Data}  \label{sec:data}


\subsection{Local Taxation in Ohio}

Ohio consists of 88 counties, each covering about 464 square miles (1,200 square kilometers).  Each county was historically divided into about 15 equally-sized townships, which do not cross county lines.  Citizens can petition to incorporate as a village, which has a different type of government structure than a township and the ability to levy both income and property taxes, whereas townships may only levy property taxes.  When a village exceeds 5,000 population in Ohio it is reclassified as a city.  Villages and cities may cross township and county lines, dissolve, or annex parts of contiguous townships.  Villages, cities and townships, which we call “cities” for brevity, are the most local governmental unit in Ohio. Each local government covers about 18.2 square miles (47.1 km2) on average. The Ohio Revised Code lets local governments collect a small amount of tax without a vote.  Beyond this limited amount local governments put tax levies on the ballot to ask for additional money from voters.  
The type of tax levy we study is for the renewal of infrastructure spending, which is almost entirely road maintenance.  Levies that pass typically expire, and the most common duration to collect a levy is five years, representing 89\% of the road tax levies in our sample.  If a tax levy is renewed, taxes and funding continue.  If 50\% or fewer votes approve the levy, it fails.  When a tax levy for additional funding fails, there is no increase in funding, but existing funding from other tax levies continues as normal.  When a renewal tax levy fails, funding from that tax levy stops.  99\% of the road tax levies in our sample are property taxes and 1\% are income taxes.

Most regression discontinuity studies that use voting data to look at the impact of funding changes examine new tax levies for additional funding.  \cite{cellini2010value} observes that votes for additional tax money may not be statistically independent; a vote may be proposed until it passes.  We minimize this source of endogeneity of new votes by only considering renewal votes \citep{brasington2017school}.  While a government may choose when to put a vote for additional funding on the ballot and keep proposing the new tax until it is passed, when a vote passes it has an expiration date.  So if a road tax levy for additional funding passes in 2007 to last five years, in 2012 voters will have the chance to renew or reject the tax.  The timing of the vote in 2012 is not endogenous, having been set in 2007.  If voters renew it in 2012, it will be up for renewal again in 2017. 

Road tax levies cover a broad range of activities.  Most of the renewal taxes we consider have stated purposes of “road and bridges repair”, “road repair”, “street fund”, and “street improvements”, although there are less common stated purposes like “repair and maintenance of streets and sewers system” and “resurfacing and rehabilitation of city streets.”  The construction of new roads and bridges, in contrast, would be funded with a tax levy for additional money, not a renewal tax; and it would likely be funded by a bond levy lasting 20 or 30 years.  We eliminate from our dataset stated purposes that might suggest new road construction like a 30-year 1.9-mill new tax in Moscow Village for “permanent improvements” and 0.5-mill new tax for 20 years in Shawnee Hills Village for “general construction and road and bridges repair.” Our dataset includes tax levies like a 2-mill, 5-year renewal in Adams Township (Champaign County) in 1995; a 3-mill, 5-year renewal in Lore City Village in 2016; and a 2.5-mill, 5-year renewal in Pataskala City in 2007.


\subsection{Tax Cuts \& Visual Evidence of Road Quality}

To further understand what separates the areas which regularly pass their levies from the areas which often fail to renew their levies, we identify ten cities with the largest number of successful renewals and failed renewals, which necessitate cutting funding. We share this information in Table \ref{tab:max_renewals_cuts}.

Table \ref{tab:max_renewals_cuts} shows that there are certain cities which always renew their road tax levies and other cities which often cut their renewal tax levies. Interestingly, we find two townships, Andover and Morgan, which belong to the same county of Ashtabula but exhibit very different behavior in terms of their voting patterns. Andover township passed all the road tax levies that were up for election whereas Morgan township failed to renew more than 56\% of its renewal levies. Since both the townships belong to the same county and have similar characteristics, we can effectively identify whether cutting road spending via road tax levies have a tangible impact on the quality of roads in the area. For this, we leverage Google Street Maps (GSM). Since photos of roads on GSM are time-stamped and the same area can have photos from different points in time, this feature allows us to observe the evolving condition of roads in these neighborhoods over time. For instance, we can observe the major streets of Andover township and compare them with the main streets of Morgan township. We checked whether there were any road tax renewals that took place between these available dates and then observed whether the road conditions improved, stayed the same or deteriorated during this period. Figure \ref{fig:rd_andover} shows Grand Army of the Republic Hwy, a specific hub in Andover, for periods 2007 and 2022. The road quality appears to have been maintained well over the years, indicating that consistent renewal of road tax levies contributes to sustained road infrastructure quality. In contrast, Figure \ref{fig:rd_morgan} illustrates the condition of OH-45 and W Water St in Morgan township for the years 2009 and 2018. The deterioration as well as continuation of poor road quality is evident, suggesting that the failure to renew road tax levies has a tangible negative impact on roads. The disparity in road conditions between Andover and Morgan townships may be suggestive of the broader economic implications of fiscal policy decisions at the local level, particularly how underinvestment in infrastructure can lead to tangible declines in public asset quality and potentially hinder economic growth and development.

\subsection{Running Variable}

The running variable plays a critical role in regression discontinuity.  In our case it represents the proportion of votes against the renewal of a road tax levy.  A vote share of less than 50 means the tax will no longer be collected, and road funding from that particular tax levy will stop.  Other road tax levies may continue to be in effect, and funds from current expense tax levies may still be used for road maintenance.  There are 3,188 votes in our sample, 83\% of which renew the tax, and 17\% of which cut taxes and road maintenance.

We quantify the size of the cut in road spending a city faces in two ways.  First, not every city has a tax levy in effect specifically for roads, but every city has current expense tax funding.  Our mean 1.9 mill road tax represents 13.6\% of current expense funding, indicating that cities that fail to renew a road tax levy face a moderate reduction in funding.  We also investigate the drop in road expenditures by sampling financial audits of cities in our sample whose renewal tax levies fail, finding an average drop of \$218,808 in road spending one year later.  This \$218,808 drop represents a 34\% decrease in road spending.  
In our sample, the mean vote share against the tax levy is 0.38, which is essentially the same as the median of 0.36.  The standard deviation is 0.15, so that the typical levy that fails represents a little less than one standard deviation away from the mean. The Great Financial Crisis falls in the middle of our dataset, so readers might wonder if voting behavior was affected, but we find vote share the same to two decimal points during and outside the years 2008-2009. 


\subsection{Outcome Variables}

We study three different outcomes:  house prices, wages, and employment, although the most consistent set of treatment effects are for house prices.  

\subsubsection{Median Housing Price}

Our house price data comes from a CoreLogic® dataset of actual sales transaction prices in Ohio from 1995 through 2021 containing a little more than 7 million observations. The dependent variable, \textit{Median House Price}, reflects the median sale price of houses within a specific city and year. For example, for the houses sold in Delaware Township during the year 2002, the median sale price was \$205,041. We take precaution to only include arm’s-length transactions, and we restrict our attention to single-family residential structures for comparability.  The overall sample mean for the 10-year period from the time of vote considered in this study is \$166,082 in constant 2010 dollars with a standard deviation of \$372,135 which suggests presence of some outliers. Although our use of median sale price addresses outliers, our robustness check in Section 4.1.2 drops 1\% tails and re-estimates the treatment effects.  The mean for this winsorized sample is \$150,375 in constant 2010 dollars with a standard deviation of \$116,020. A staple feature of regression discontinuity studies is a graph of the outcome variable against the running variable. Figures \ref{fig:rd_hp_1} and \ref{fig:rd_hp_2} shows house prices from years $t+1$ to $t+8$ after the vote graphed against the percent of votes for the tax levy.

Scatterplots like Figure \ref{fig:rd_hp_1} and \ref{fig:rd_hp_2}, although expected in regression discontinuity studies, should be read with caution, because the dots in the graphs do not represent actual house prices or vote shares.  A graph of actual data would illustrate a mess of dots for which no human could see a discernible pattern.  Graphing involves averaging vote shares into bins representing a narrow range of vote shares and summarizing the wide range of house prices within each bin with a single mean value.  For this reason, graphs do not necessarily track treatment effects that come from formal regression analysis using actual individual data points.  Nevertheless, the graphs in Figure \ref{fig:rd_hp_1} and \ref{fig:rd_hp_2} representing 8 years after the vote may show a discount in house prices from cutting taxes and road maintenance. Corresponding estimates and graphs for treatment effects in the full set of years $t+1$ through $t+10$ relative to the vote can be found in Figure \ref{fig:tes_gs_app} and Table \ref{tab:median_sale_amount_full} in the Appendix.

\subsubsection{Employment and Wages}

We obtain special permission from the Ohio Department of Jobs and Family Services (ODJFS) to access establishment-level data on wages and employment.  It shows total wages and the average number of employees for each quarter.  We aggregate up from quarterly to yearly values.  Each establishment has an address, which we geocode to the proper local government jurisdiction (city, village or township), and we aggregate total wages and average employment up to the local government level to match the unit of geography of the voting data. The outcome variables considered were “Average employment” and “Wages per capita”, where average employment is the average number of employees on the payroll in a particular city during a specific year, and wages per capita is aggregate total wages paid to the employees on the payroll in particular city during a year divided by average employment. Graphs of these outcome variables are available upon request.  Within the typical effective bandwidth of 14 percentage points, mean city-level employment is 1,575 for the fail levy group with a standard deviation of 3,319; and it is 1,342 with a standard deviation of 3,514 for the pass levy group the year before the vote.  

The average wage outcome we study also has similar means within the effective bandwidth the year before the vote.  For the high-poverty sample, the sample with the only significant treatment effects, mean wages in 2010 dollars are \$29,153 for the fail-levy sample with a standard deviation of 8,515; and they are \$29,968 for the pass-levy sample with a standard deviation of 7,524.

\subsection{Covariates}

Covariates can be useful in regression discontinuity studies, although they are not necessary for the identification of treatment effects.  One use of covariates is to increase the precision of treatment effect estimates.  The other is to see if cities that barely pass and fail tax levies are similar to each other like the theory of regression discontinuity says they should be. Table \ref{tab:variable_means_sd} shows covariate means for both the global sample of all votes in the data set as well as the local sample within a representative effective bandwidth of the 0.50 cutoff. The effective bandwidth displayed in Table \ref{tab:variable_means_sd} is the mean bandwidth for all the housing outcome regressions. The first columns for the global sample show similar values of characteristics between cities that renew and cut road taxes and spending, but it is the two rightmost columns that are critical for the credibility of the regression discontinuity design.   

Table \ref{tab:variable_means_sd} demonstrates the covariate balance between cities that renew their tax levies and those that do not, indicating similar demographic and economic profiles across both groups. The data, captured at the time of the vote, shows minimal differences within the effective bandwidth: the mean population differs by only 224 from a base of 5,220, and median family income varies by \$190 from a base of \$60,269, measured in 2010 U.S. dollars. Other variables, including poverty rates, single-parent household percentages, educational attainment, age distribution, and racial composition, show differences of less than one percentage point, reinforcing the comparability of the two groups.

%     \item Notes: Panel A shows covariates used in estimating the treatment effect of failing to renew a road tax levy. Covariate means at the time of the vote are shown along with standard deviations in parentheses. The unit of observation is city-year. 'Income' is median family income in constant 2010 U.S. dollars. 'Global' refers to the full sample of city-year votes; 'Effective' refers to city-year votes within the mean estimated optimal bandwidth of 10 percentage points around the cutoff for years 1995 through 2021. The treatment group reflects cutting road funding by failing to renew the road tax levy. The control group reflects maintaining road funding by renewing the road tax levy. Panel B shows means of outcome variables for placebo years t - 3, t - 2, and t - 1.

Table \ref{tab:variable_means_sd} shows that the treatment and control groups are well-balanced with respect to the covariates considered, suggesting that the groups are comparable and any observed differences in outcomes can more confidently be attributed to the treatment effect rather than to pre-existing differences.

\subsection{Testing how well the data meets the assumptions of RDD}

The assumptions of regression discontinuity are minimal compared to other identification strategies.  One is that no agent, while having some influence, may precisely assign observations to a specific value of the running variable.  In our context, it means that higher levels of government, foreign governments, or the firm that programs the voting machines may not dictate vote share for city road tax levies.  The standard way to test this assumption is to perform a density test like that of \cite{cattaneo2020simple}, which is based on the idea that a manipulating agent might cause a clustering of votes just to one side of the cutoff, with a pronounced drop-off on the other side of the cutoff.  The $p$-value of this density test is 0.98. A histogram of vote share is shown in Figure \ref{fig:running_var_hist} that graphically illustrates the lack of abrupt change in density.  

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,keepaspectratio]{images/votes_pct_against_histogram.png}
    \caption{Histogram of Running Variable}
    \label{fig:running_var_hist}
\end{figure}

Although Table \ref{tab:variable_means_sd} shows covariate balance between sets of cities that pass and fail to renew road tax levies, covariate values could still jump from one side of the cutoff to another. A drop in education levels, for example, could cause a drop in house prices that might coincide with a change in treatment, so that what might look like a treatment effect from cutting taxes and spending might in fact be caused by lower education levels.  Graphs of covariate smoothness around the cutoff are found in the Appendix \ref{sec:appxb}. A formal way to assess covariate smoothness is to use each covariate as an outcome variable in a regression of the running variable and a treatment effect dummy. When we do so, the $p$-value of the treatment effect dummy varies from 0.13 to 0.98, indicating no statistically significant jump in covariate values. 

\section{Methodology} \label{sec:method}

We follow a model of sharp Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD), as detailed in \cite{calonico2019regression}. A formal description of the model is provided below. Let $Y_{it}$ represent the outcome variable for city, village or township $i$ at year $t$. The outcome variables we study include house prices, wages, and employment. Drawing from the Rubin causal model, we use potential outcomes notation to describe $Y_{it}(1)$ as a potential outcome variable if exposed to treatment and $Y_{it}(0)$ as the potential outcome variable in absence of treatment i.e. our control. We define treatment as failure of a city, village or township to renew its road maintenance tax levy. Let $T_{it} \in \{0,1\}$ represent cities that receive treatment (1) or not (0) based on voting at year $t$, so that our realized outcome is represented by the following equation:

$$
Y_{it} = Y_{it}(1) \times T_{it} + Y_{it}(0) \times (1-T_{it})
$$

Let $X_{it}$ be the running variable that determines whether a realized outcome variable was treated or not based on some cutoff $\underbar{x}$. In our study, the running variable is the percent of votes against the renewal tax levy and the cutoff is 50 percent. Let $Z_{it}$ be our vector of covariates and $\tau$ be our parameter of interest i.e. the treatment effect. This parameter of interest measures the causal effect of cutting road maintenance spending on different outcome variables. Under the assumption of continuity at the cutoff $\underbar{x}$, the RDD allows us to compute the average treatment effect $\tau = \mathbb{E}(Y_{it}(1) - Y_{it}(0) | X_{it} = \underbar{x})$. We employ both local polynomial and local randomization approaches to compute the estimate for $\tau$, which we call $\hat{\tau}$.

To observe the persistence of treatment effects, we develop an event study-styled estimator that tracks the outcome variable for different values in future. The regression equation takes the form -

$$
Y_{i(t+r)} = \alpha_r + T_{i(t+r)} \tau_r + X_{i(t+r)} \beta_r + T_{i(t+r)} X_{i(t+r)} \theta_r + Z_{i(t+r)} \gamma_r + \epsilon_{i(t+r)}
$$

\noindent where $r \in \{-3,-2, ..., 10 \}$, $\alpha_r$ is the intercept, $\beta_r$ is the coefficient on the running variable $X_{i(t+r)}$, $\theta_r$ is the coefficient of the interaction term, $\gamma_r$ is a vector of coefficients for covariates matrix $Z_{i(t+r)}$ and $\epsilon_{i(t+r)}$ is the idiosyncratic error term. Our parameter of interest, $\tau_r$ measures the causal effect of cutting road maintenance spending on different outcome variables for different values of $r$. We estimate the treatment effect for different values of $r$ to observe the persistence of treatment effects and consider the possibly of placebo effects. 

The above equation has been described in detail in \cite{calonico2019regression} and is called the covariate-adjusted RDD estimator. We use the bandwidth selection method described in \cite{calonico2019regression} to choose a bandwidth $h$ and then conduct a local linear polynomial regression after choosing a weighting scheme. The bandwidth $h$ determines size of the neighborhood around the cutoff $\underbar{x}$, where the neighborhood is $(\underbar{x}-h, \underbar{x}+h)$. Only observations with values of the running variable within this neighborhood are used to compute the treatment effect estimate $\hat{\tau}$ and, for a small enough neighborhood, the continuity assumption central to the RDD estimator is satisfied. The weighting scheme $k$ determines the weights of the observations within the neighborhood $(\underbar{x}-h, \underbar{x}+h)$ and is another important factor in determining $\hat{\tau}$. The most common types of weighting schemes are uniform, triangular and Epanechnikov. We use the default Mean Squared Error Regression Discontinuity (MSERD) method to compute the effective bandwidth ($h$) and bias bandwidth ($b$) for each outcome variable. This method identifies the bandwidth that minimizes the trade-off between bias and variance of the treatment effect estimate. All observations are used to estimate $h$ and $b$, but only the observations within the selected bandwidth $h$ i.e. effective observations within $h$ percentage points on either side of the 0.50 vote share cutoff are used to identify our treatment effect estimates.
