Roads are an important form of infrastructure investment that affect firms’ production functions and people’s commuting costs. Many studies examine the importance of roads and how they affect residents' daily lives (\Citeauthor{currier2023} \citeyear{currier2023}; \Citeauthor{adukia2020} \citeyear{adukia2020}, \Citeauthor{banerjee2020} \citeyear{banerjee2020}; \Citeauthor{banerjee2020} \citeyear{banerjee2020}, \Citeauthor{banerjee2020} \citeyear{banerjee2020}). Some papers emphasize that building new roads increases employment and entry of new firms \citep{gibbons2019new}, thereby increasing economic activity. Other papers point out the potential for worse outcomes in the form of increased inequality between the rich and the poor \citep{hettige2006} and an exodus of workers seeking access to larger labor markets \citep{asher2020}.  
 
In this paper, we highlight the importance of maintaining road spending for cities in Ohio. We collect data on more than 3,000 renewal road-tax levy elections conducted within different county subdivisions, including townships, cities and villages, in Ohio (referred to as "cities" for brevity). Using regression discontinuity design, we examine how these exogeneous cuts in maintenance spending influence key economic outcomes, focusing on cities where voting results were narrowly decided. Our results reveal that when a city cuts its renewal road taxes, maintenance spending drops by 34\%, road quality declines by 17\% and house prices decreases by around \$16,000, with the effect starting four years after the vote and persisting through nine years after the vote. This discount in house prices represents about 9 percent of house value over the decade.  The delayed effect is consistent with the time it takes for roads to deteriorate noticeably.  We further find that these price effects are more pronounced in urban areas, where house prices fall by approximately \$25,825 on average, compared to no significant changes in values of houses in rural areas. We also observe that higher-priced homes experience larger reductions in value relative to lower-priced homes, indicating a heterogeneous impact across different quantiles of home prices. On the other hand, we find little evidence for any overall change in wages or employment as a result of the decreased road maintenance spending for our full sample.  We do find, however, an effect on employment and wages in high-poverty cities.  Cities above the 75th percentile of poverty that cut road maintenance taxes have 17.8\% lower wages than otherwise similar cities that barely renew road tax levies.  High-poverty cities that cut road tax levies also lose about 11\% more jobs than those that successfully renew maintenance spending.  We speculate that the amenity value of attractive roads, changes in business productivity, and compensating wage differentials are probably responsible for the results, rather than changes in traffic noise or crime rates.
